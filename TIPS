* E prover start up lag on cygwin

It seems that cygwin processes have to check some credentials, which may cause a
lag in starting.  (I was getting a lag of about 3 seconds, which was longer than
the timeout!)

Solution: Use cygserver running in the background (I installed it as a service)
to cache credentials and improve performance.  (There may be better solutions.
This worked for me.)
