How should the proof search mechanism be designed?

It needs to support backtracking search.
It needs to support case analysis.
It would be nice if it generated some sort of proof term/audit trail.
It should minimize redundancy.  (i.e. don't reprove goals)

Representation should be largely agnostic to search technique.
