===================================

 1. External Provers

  1.1 Z3

CAPER uses the Z3 SMT solver from Microsoft Research, via the Haskell SBV
library.  This requires a version of Z3 of *at least 4.3.2*, which is only
available as an unstable version.  I have been using
z3-4.3.2.ff265c6c6ccf-x64-win.

Z3 can be downloaded from: http://z3.codeplex.com/

The Z3 executable must be in your path.

  1.2 E

CAPER optionally uses the E theorem prover by Stephan Schulz.  I have been using
version 1.8 "Gopaldhara".

E can be downloaded from: http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/E/E.html

The executable for E should be specified in config.ini.  To build E on Windows,
you will probably use Cygwin, and must therefore ensure cygwin.dll is in the
path.

 2. Configuration: config.ini

The file config.ini specifies configuration options for CAPER.  A template file
config.ini.default is provided, which lists the various available options.
