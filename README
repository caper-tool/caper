```

Add the bin directory to your PATH, as following

```
export PATH="$Z3PATH/bin:$PATH"
```

Make sure you have GHC 7.8.3.
It can be downloaded from: https://www.haskell.org/platform/download/2014.2.0.0/Haskell%20Platform%202014.2.0.0%2064bit.signed.pkg

Go to the Caper directory you just downloaded.

First create a sandbox using the command:

```
cabal sandbox init
```

Install the z3 Haskell bindings as following:

```
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$Z3PATH/bin
cabal install z3-4.0.0 --extra-include-dirs=$Z3PATH/include --extra-lib-dirs=$Z3PATH/bin
